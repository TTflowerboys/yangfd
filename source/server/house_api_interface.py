    This API will act based on the house_id. To be specific, if any field other than "status" is edited:

    1. If the house has ``status`` in (``draft``, ``not translated``, ``translating``, ``rejected``), the changes will be saved immediately.

    1.1. If the ``status`` is ``rejected``, it will be automatically changed to ``draft`` upon any edit.

    2. If ``status`` is ``not reviewed``, the edit will be rejected. Cancel the review process before you can do any more edit.

    3. Otherwise this API will actually create a partial house with only the changes. After approval:

    3.1. If ``target_house_id`` present, the changes and the ``status`` will be applied together to that house if the ``status`` was submitted within (``selling``, ``hidden``, ``sold out``, ``deleted``) and the partial house will be removed.

    3.2. Otherwise, the status of _this_ partial house will be updated to whatever the reviewer submitted, so it reforms a "real" new house.

    Edit ``status`` to advance the process. For ``status``-only submits, the following rules are followed:

    4. If ``status`` in (``draft``, ``not translated``, ``translating``, ``rejected``, ``not reviewed``)

    4.1. Anyone could submit ``status``-only edits and they will be saved immediately. But only ``admin``, ``jr_admin`` and ``operation`` could advance the status beyond "not reviewed".

    5. Otherwise, only ``admin``, ``jr_admin`` and ``operation`` could send ``status``-only edits, and the ``status`` is limited to (``selling``, ``hidden``, ``sold out``, ``deleted``). If you need to edit it in any way, go with the previous process.

    When submitting a (partial or full) house for reviewing:

    6. A house without all needed fields _and_ ``target_house_id`` will raise an error here.

    After discussion, we've decided that only one "draft" was allowed for the same "target_house_id" at the same time. This means:

    7. The first edit to an existing house should pass the house's id to ``target_house_id``.

    8. The second and so forth edits should only pass the current ``partial`` house's id to ``target_house_id``.

    9. Submit another edit while an existing one still in its life cycle will cause an error.

    All statuses, for reference: ``draft``, ``not translated``, ``translating``, ``rejected``, ``not reviewed``, ``selling``, ``hidden``, ``sold out``, ``deleted``.
