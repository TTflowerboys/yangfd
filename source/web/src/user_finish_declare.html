                Self-Certified Sophisticated Investor Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
               I declare that I am a self-certified sophisticated investor for the purposes of the restriction on promotion of non-mainstream pooled investments. I understand that this means:

(i) I can receive promotional communications made by a person who is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority which relate to investment activity in non-mainstream pooled investments;

(ii) the investments to which the promotions will relate may expose me to a significant risk of losing all of the property invested.

I am a self-certified sophisticated investor because at least one of the following applies:

(a) I am a member of a network or syndicate of business angels and have been so for at least the last six months prior to the date below;

(b) I have made more than one investment in an unlisted company in the two years prior to the date below;

(c) I am working, or have worked in the two years prior to the date below, in a professional capacity in the private equity sector, or in the provision of finance for small and medium enterprises; and

(d) I am currently, or have been in the two years prior to the date below, a director of a company with an annual turnover of at least £1 million.

I accept that the investments to which the promotions will relate may expose me to a significant risk of losing all of the money or other property invested. I am aware that it is open to me seek advice from someone who specialises in advising on non-mainstream pooled investments.

                High Net Worth Investor Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
                I make this statement so that I can receive promotional communications which are exempt from the restriction on promotion of 
non-mainstream pooled investments. The exemption relates to certified high net worth investors and I declare that I qualify as 
such because at least one of the following applies to me:
 
I had, throughout the financial year immediately preceding today's date, an annual income to the value of £100,000 or more;
 
I held, throughout the financial year immediately preceding today's date, net assets to the value of £250,000 or more. Net assets for 
these purposes do not include:
 
(a) the property which is my primary residence or any money raised through a loan secured on that property;
 
(b) any rights of mine under a qualifying contract of insurance; or
 
(c) any benefits (in the form of pensions or otherwise) which are payable on the termination of my service or on my death or 
retirement and to which I am (or my dependants are), or may be, entitled.
 
I accept that the investments to which the promotions will relate may expose me to a significant risk of losing all of the money or 
other property invested. I am aware that it is open to me to seek advice from an authorised person who specialises in advising on 
non-mainstream pooled investments.
